# C++ Expression Calculator

## About
Calculator of an arbitrary mathematical expression. Designed to put the shunting-yard algorithm into practice in C++.

## Examples
Examples of expressions that the program can calculate.

Containing exponentional functions: `3*(2.135-0.55)^log(e^2)+5`\
Containing trigonometric functions: `sin(pi/6)^2 + cos(pi/6)^2`

It is possible to combine them as you want.

## Simplified version
In the simplified version, an expression is entered with a separation of elements by spaces, validation checks removed. Made for an easier understanding of the algorithm.

Example of correct expression: `( 1 + 2.5 ) * ( 3 + ( 4 - 5.2 ) )`
